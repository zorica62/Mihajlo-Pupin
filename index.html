        also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. 
        
        Pupin is best known for his numerous patents,
         including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire)
         at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization"). 
        
        Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.
